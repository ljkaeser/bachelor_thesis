The mcs_rdd files provide the code for the Monte-Carlo simulations from Section 4 of my thesis. 
I created two separate files to differentiate between the low and high curvature setting. 
However, the code is essentially the same except for the data generating functions that are defined at the beginning of the code. 

The app_rdd file provides the code for the application from Section 5 of my thesis. 
Prof. Lalive was so kind to provide me access to his data from his paper on unemployment duration: 
Lalive, R. (2008). How do extended benefits affect unemployment duration? A regression discontinuity approach. Journal of econometrics, 142(2), 785-806.
The code starts by performing identification and specification tests presented in Section 2.4 and concludes with the estimation of the average treatment effect.
